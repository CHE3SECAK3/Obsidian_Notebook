# Motion of a Dipole
- In a constant electric field, $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = 0$

	- This is becase the poles (2 point charges) have an equal and opposite force acting on them

- However, a dipole may have a rotational force (or torque) acting on it

$$\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}$$
where:

- $\vec{\tau}$ : Torque
- $\vec{p}$ : Dipole moment
