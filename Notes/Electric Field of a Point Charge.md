# Electric Field of a Point Charge
> [!note] Electric Field Equation
> $$\vec{E} = K \large{\frac{q}{r^2}} \hat r$$ where:
> - $K$ : Coulomb's Constant
> - $q$ : Source charge
> 	- The sign of the charge matters!
> 
> 	- $+q$ : The field points away from source charge
> 	  (in the direction of $\hat r$)
>
> 	- $-q$ : The field points towards the source charge
> 	  (opposite direction of $\hat r$)
>
> - $r$ : An arbitrary distance from the source charge
> - $\hat r$ : Unit vector of the distance between the source charge and any arbitrary point

> [!note] Coulomb's Law
> - Notice the similarities between [[Coulomb's Law]] and the Electric Field equation.
>   
> 	- $\vec{E}$ only needs one *source charge*
> 	- Coulomb's Law uses a pair of charges
