# Electric Potential Energy of Point Charges
> [!note] Electric Potential Energy Equation 
> $$U_\text{elec} = K \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r} $$

> [!note] $U$ vs $F_{\text{elec}}$
> - Coulombic force is inversely proprtional to $r^2$ whereas electric potential energy is inversely proportional to $r$   

> [!success] Electric Potential Proof
> ![[Electric Potential Energy of Two Point Charge System]]
> - The proof uses two similar charges (as seen by the repelling force)
> - Two opposite charges will just have a negative electric potential instead, and will have $U = 0J$ at $\infty$


## $U_\text{elec}$ of Multiple Point-Charge System

$$U_\text{sys} = \sum\limits U_i$$
- where:
	- $i$ : Point charge pair
