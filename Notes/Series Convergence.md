## Series Convergence
Suppose $S_n$ is a partial sum of $n$ terms in a sequence $a_n$.

A series converges if the sequence of partial sums $\{S_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ also converges.

If the series *does* converge:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n 
$$

> The limit of the infinte partial sum is the series!
