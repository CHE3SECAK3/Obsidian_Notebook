# Charging by Induction
- Method of charging an object without contact with another charged object.

- Conductors and insulators have different behaviors when charged by induciton.

## Conductor
***Charge Polarization***

![[Charging Conductors by Induction]]

- Free-flowing valence electrons in a neutral conductor are displaced based on the charge of the rod.
> [!warning] Note
> Only *electrons* move throughout the conductor. Nuclei (and their protons) stay in place.
> - \+ indicates postive ions
> - \- indicates negative ions

- The conductor is *polarized.* 
- There is a $F_{net}$ towards the rod (attraction) since the repelling force in either scenario is further away from the rod, and is therefore weaker.

- Moving the rod away will readjust the "sea of electrons" to its equilibrium

## Insulator
***Electric Dipole***

![[Charging Insulators by Induction]]

- Bounded electrons in a neutral insulator now gravitate towards or away from the charged rod but stay within the electron cloud of an atom.

- Individual *dipole* atoms produce an attraction force towards the rod.
	- Weaker than that of a conductors. 

- Moving the rod away will neutralize the atoms
