# Oscillation
- *Repeating motion around a point of equilibrium*

- Oscillations are periodic, meaning they repeat at constant intervals of time

## Elements of an Oscillation

### Period
- *One cycle in an oscillation*
- Symbol: $T$ in seconds

### Amplitude

### Frequency

- Sinusoidal oscillation

# Hooke's Law
- The amount of force needed to compress or stretch a spring is linearly proportional to its displacement

$$F_{\text{sp}} = -k\vec{x}$$
- where:
	- $F_{\text{sp}}$ : Restoring force $N$
	- $k$ : Spring constant $\frac{N}{m}$
	- $\vec{x}$ : Displacement $m$

> [!note] Spring constant $k$
> - Intrinsic property of the spring itself
> 	- Determines how much force is required to stretch or compress a spring a unit distance (Newtons of force per meter, or $\frac{N}{m}$)
> 	
> 	- A tougher spring has a higher $k$, since it requires more force to manipulate it, while a looser spring has a smaller $k$ value

- The spring applies no force on the object at equilibrium ($x = 0, F_{\text{sp}} = \vec{0}$)

> [!question] Why is there a negative sign?
> - The resoting force is always in the opposite direction of displacement
> 
> - When stretching a spring, the spring wants to shrink back to its equilibrium position
> - When compressing the spring, it wants to spread out to its equilibrium position
