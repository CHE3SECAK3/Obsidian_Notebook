# Wave

- *A patterned travelling disturbance through a space*

- A *transverse* wave has individual points of the wave moving perpendicular to the perception of the wave's motion

- A *longitudinal* wave has individual points of the wave moving parallel with the perception of the wave's motion

## Wave Speed

- The wave speed $v$ is the speed at which a ripple of the wave travels across a medium

>[!warning] Waves and Motion

$$v_{s} = \sqrt{\frac{T_{s}}{\mu}}$$ where:

- $v_{s}$ : Wave speed on a string

- $T_{s}$ : Tension of the string
- $\mu$ : Linear density of the string
	- $\mu = \frac{m}{L}$ where:
		- $m$ : Mass of the string
		- $L$ : Length of the string


- A wave can be mathematically represented by deriving an equation that determines the displacement of any point in the medium at any given time.

- Given a sinusoidal wave:
$$D(x, t = 0) = A\sin(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}x + \phi_{0})$$
- where:
	- $x$ : Any point on the medium
	- $t = 0$ : A fixed point in time
	- $\lambda$ : Wavelength
	- $\phi_{0}$ : Phase constant

- A wave with a speed of $v$ traveling to the right for $t$ seconds would have travelled $vt$ distance. That means for a given $x$,
