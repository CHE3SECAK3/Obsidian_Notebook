# TCR
- Temperature Coefficient of Resisitance
- Materials expand and contract due to heat which impacts resistance
- Metals have +TCR -> INCR TEMP = INCR RESistance
- Semi conductors have - TCR INCR TEMP = DECR REs
- TCR is self-limiting for conductors
	- INCR TEMP = INCR RESis = LES POWER = DECR TEMP = ...
- TCR is NOT self limiting in semis -> Thermal runaway
	- INCR TEMP = DECR RES = MORE POWER = INCRESSE TEMP = ...
