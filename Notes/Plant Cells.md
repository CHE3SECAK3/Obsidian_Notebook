# Cell Structure
- Cell Wall --> Cell Membrane --> Protoplasm --> Organelles

## Cell Wall
- Made of *cellulose* : Linked glucose molecules
- Provides structure and protection
- All plant cells have a thin, flexible *primary cell wall*
- Some cells have additional thick, rigid *secondary cell wall*
- Walls are are of a layered mesh of *cellulose microfibrils*


## Plasma Membrane
- Selectively permeable barrier that regulates momevement of substances in and out of the cell
	- Molecular pumps within the membrane facilitate transport of molecules
- Primarily consists of two layers of phospholipids and different proteins

### Plasmodesmata
- Small channels that connect neighboring cells together fofr the exchange of chemical signals that extend from the cell membrane

## Nucleus
- Control center and genetic archive
	- Stores DNA : Instructions for making enzymes and proteins
- Nulcei are bound by a *nuclear envelope*, consisting of an inner and outer membrane and uses small holes called *nuclear pores* to transport material

## Chloroplast
- Specialized organelle where photosynthesis occurs
$$\text{sunlight} + \text{water} + \text{carbon dioxide} = \text{sugar / energy}$$
- Contains chlorophyll - green pigment
- Variegated plants: some cells acquire mutations that prevent the production of chlorophyll

## Mitochondria
- Where cellular respiration occur
- Takes sugar and starches into useable energy
- Similar structure to chloroplasts
	- Inner folded membrane

## Vacuole
- Occupy the majority of cell volume
- Store water, nutrients, waste products
- Maintain cell pressure
- Contains *anthocyanin*, a purplish pigment which overshadows the effects of green seen by chlorophyll

## Mitosis

- Plants have 3 main types of cells:
	- Parenchyma
	- Collenchyma
	- Sclerenchyma
# Plant Tissue
## Parenchyma Tissue
- Alive at maturity
- Most common type of cell and tissue
- Thin primary cell walls
- Large central vacuole
- Can take on many shapes
- Has many functions (photosynthesis, storage / transport of nutrients, etc)

- Storage parenchyma cells have amyloplasts that store starch molecules (for energy)
- Similar to choloplast structure

## Collenchyma Tissue
- Composed of living primary cell walls
- Flexible support organ

## Sclerenchyma Tissue
- Dead at maturity
- Thick secondary cell walls reinforced by *lignin*
- Cell type:
	1. Fiber
		- Thread like structure
		- Elongated sclerenchyma cell
		- Provides structure to leaves, stems, roots, etc
		- Abundant in fibers
	2. Sclereids
		- Stone cells
		- Form hard tissue of nuts, seed coats, etc
		- Compact shape
		- Usually with thin-walled parenchyma cells

### Cellulosic vs Natural Fibers
- Cellulosic: Plant fibers processed to a pulp and extruded like sunthetic fiber
- Natural fiber: Whole, natural fibers
- Spunlaid: Nonwowev fibers like coffee filters


# Plant Tissue System
## Epidermal (Surface) Tissue
- Outermost layer of cells (epidermis)
- Stops water from seeping in and out of the cell wall
	- Covered with a waxy cuticle layer to prevent water loss
- Cell types:
	- Epidermal cells, root hairs, guard cells, trichomes

### Glandular Trichomes
- *Leaf hairs*
- Attached directly to the surface of the epidermis
- Different function for different plants
	- Capturing insects
	- Decreased air flow to reduce water loss
	- Chemical signal emitters
	- Pain

### Stomata
- Pores in leaves and stems where gas exchange occurs and water evaporates
- Surrounded by guard cells to open and close the pores
	- $CO_{2}$ enters, $O_{2}$ and water exists

## Ground Tissue
- Between epidermal and vascular tissue as a "filling tissue"
- Made of parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma
- Variety of functions (photosynthesis, storage, support)

## Vascular Tissue
- Specialized tissue for sugar and water transportation
- 2 distinct tissues:
	1. Xylem: Water conducting tissue
	2. Phloem: Sugar conducting tissue

### Xylem
- Transports water and minerals
- Strong structure and held by a lot of lignin
- Composed of different cell types
	- Tracheids: Tapered at the ends, water passes betw tracheids through thin areas in the cell wall called pits
	- Vessel elements: Long tubular cells open at both ends, arranged end to end forming vessels that function like water pipes
	- Vessels are more efficient water conductors than tracheids
		- However, tracheids are good at supporting water pressure as it travels up and down the plant
- Made of fibers and parenchyma as well

### Phloem
- Transports sugats and other substances
- Sieve tube members
	- Long tubular cells with sieve plates in the end walls, arranged end to end, alive but lack a nucleus
- Copmanion cells
	- Help and mediate the transport of sugars in sieve tubes members
	- Contains genetic information and maintains pressure in the tissue
- Also made of some fibers and parenchyma

# Primary Growth

- At the apical meristem
- At the axillary buds
- In the root system

## Phototropism and Auxin
- When sunlight is overhead, the IAA molecules produced by the meristem spread evenly in the shoot
- If the sunlight is at an angle, IAA molecules go to the other side and induces elongation towards the light

## Function of Stem
- Transport --> vasular tissue to transport water and sugar
- supprt holds leaves for photosynthesis
- storage ground tissue for storage of water adn sugar

## Internal Stem Structure
- Pith: Stem center for storage support
- Cortex
- Epidermis

## Stem Grwoth order
- Stem leaf bud consistent growth

- Stolon: modified stem " RUnner" (strawberry plant)
	- Horizontal stem above ground
	- function: vegetative reprodution

- Rhizome
	- Horizontal underground stem (ginger)

- succulent stems
	- roudn water storing stems

- bulbs: underground storage stem with flesky leaves for storage
- tuber: swollen end of underground stem
- thorn: sharp pointer stem for protection

# Root System
- Anchorage
- Absoption
- Conduction
- Storage
- Hormone Production
