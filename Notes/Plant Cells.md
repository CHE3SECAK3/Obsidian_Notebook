![[Plant Cell|1000]]

## Cell Wall
- Made of *cellulose* : Linked glucose molecules
- Provides structure and protection
- All plant cells have a thin, flexible *primary cell wall*
- Some cells have additional thick, rigid *secondary cell wall*
- Walls are are of a layered mesh of *cellulose microfibrils*


## Plasma Membrane
- Selectively permeable barrier that regulates momevement of substances in and out of the cell
	- Molecular pumps within the membrane facilitate transport of molecules
- Primarily consists of two layers of phospholipids and different proteins

### Plasmodesmata
- Small channels that connect neighboring cells together for the exchange of chemical signals
- Extend from the cell membrane

## Nucleus
- Control center and genetic archive
	- Stores DNA : Instructions for making enzymes and proteins
- Nulcei are bound by a *nuclear envelope*, consisting of an inner and outer membrane and uses small holes called *nuclear pores* to transport material

## Chloroplast
- Specialized organelle responsible for photosynthesis
$$\text{sunlight} + \text{water} + \text{carbon dioxide} = \text{sugar / energy}$$
- Contains *chlorophyll* : green pigment
- Variegated plants: some cells acquire mutations that prevent the production of chlorophyll
- Some cells acquire mutations that prevent the production of cholophyll
	- Creates multi-tonal or *variegated* plants that do not survive in the wild, but are bred by us for their appearance
- Inner folded membrane

## Mitochondria
- Responsible for *cellular respiration* : Converting sugars and starches into useable energy
- Contains an inner folded membrane like chloroplasts

## Vacuole
- Occupy the majority of cell volume
- Store water, nutrients, waste products
- Maintain cell pressure
- Contains *anthocyanin*, a purplish pigment which overshadows the effects of green due to *chlorophyll*

## Mitosis
- Process of cell division
- *Mother* cell dividing into 2 genetically identical *daughter* cells
