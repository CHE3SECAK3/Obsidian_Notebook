# Cell Structure
- Cell Wall --> Cell Membrane --> Protoplasm --> Organelles

## Cell Wall
- Made of *cellulose* : Linked glucose molecules
- Provides structure and protection
- All plant cells have a thin, flexible *primary cell wall*
- Some cells have additional thick, rigid *secondary cell wall*
- Walls are are of a layered mesh of *cellulose microfibrils*


## Plasma Membrane
- Selectively permeable barrier that regulates momevement of substances in and out of the cell
	- Molecular pumps within the membrane facilitate transport of molecules
- Primarily consists of two layers of phospholipids and different proteins

### Plasmodesmata
- Small channels that connect neighboring cells together for the exchange of chemical signals
- Extend from the cell membrane

## Nucleus
- Control center and genetic archive
	- Stores DNA : Instructions for making enzymes and proteins
- Nulcei are bound by a *nuclear envelope*, consisting of an inner and outer membrane and uses small holes called *nuclear pores* to transport material

## Chloroplast
- Specialized organelle responsible for photosynthesis
$$\text{sunlight} + \text{water} + \text{carbon dioxide} = \text{sugar / energy}$$
- Contains *chlorophyll* : green pigment
- Variegated plants: some cells acquire mutations that prevent the production of chlorophyll
- Some cells acquire mutations that prevent the production of cholophyll
	- Creates multi-tonal or *variegated* plants that do not survive in the wild, but are bred by us for their appearance
- Inner folded membrane

## Mitochondria
- Responsible for *cellular respiration* : Converting sugars and starches into useable energy
- Contains an inner folded membrane like chloroplasts

## Vacuole
- Occupy the majority of cell volume
- Store water, nutrients, waste products
- Maintain cell pressure
- Contains *anthocyanin*, a purplish pigment which overshadows the effects of green due to *chlorophyll*

## Mitosis
- Process of cell division
- *Mother* cell dividing into 2 genetically identical *daughter* cells

# Primary Growth

- At the apical meristem
- At the axillary buds
- In the root system

## Phototropism and Auxin
- When sunlight is overhead, the IAA molecules produced by the meristem spread evenly in the shoot
- If the sunlight is at an angle, IAA molecules go to the other side and induces elongation towards the light

## Function of Stem
- Transport --> vasular tissue to transport water and sugar
- supprt holds leaves for photosynthesis
- storage ground tissue for storage of water adn sugar

## Internal Stem Structure
- Pith: Stem center for storage support
- Cortex
- Epidermis

## Stem Grwoth order
- Stem leaf bud consistent growth

- Stolon: modified stem " RUnner" (strawberry plant)
	- Horizontal stem above ground
	- function: vegetative reprodution

- Rhizome
	- Horizontal underground stem (ginger)

- succulent stems
	- roudn water storing stems

- bulbs: underground storage stem with flesky leaves for storage
- tuber: swollen end of underground stem
- thorn: sharp pointer stem for protection

# Root System
- Anchorage
- Absoption
- Conduction
- Storage
- Hormone Production
