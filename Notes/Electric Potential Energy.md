# Electric Potential Energy
- *Internal electric energy*
- Electric energy also follows the law of energy conservation.
	- $E_\text{mech} = U_\text{elec} + K$

> [!summary] Gravitational Analogy
> - An object a distance $h$ from the ground on Earth has a gravitational potential energy of $mgh$, where:
>
> 	- $m$ : Mass of the object
> 	- $g$ : Gravitational acceleration (constant)
> 	- $mg = W$ : Weight of the object (force)
>
> - This means that the object has a potiental of $mgh$ Joules of energy ($U$) that can be converted into kinetic energy ($K$)
> 	- $E_\text{sys} = U + K$
>

> - Similarly, a charge a distance $s$ from a "ground position" in a constant electric field has an *electric* potential energy
> $$U = qEs$$
> - where:
> 	- $q$ : Charge of point
> 	- $E$ : Electric field strength
> 	- $qE = F$ : Electric force on the object by an electric field
> 
> - Electric systems have electric potential energy (instead of gravitational) that can be converted to kinetic energy!
> 	- If $s = 0$, then all the potential energy is converted to kinetic
