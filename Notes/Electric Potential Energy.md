# Electric Potential Energy
- *Internal electric energy*

- $\Delta U = -W\quad$ where:
	- $\Delta U$ : Change in potential energy
	- $W$ : Work done

- $W = \vec{F} \cdot \Delta\vec{r} = F\Delta r\cos\theta\quad = \int\limits_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x)\cos\theta dx \quad$ where:
	- $W$ : Work
	- $F$ : Force
	- $\cdot$ : Dot product
	- $\Delta\vec{r}$ : Displacement
	- $\theta$ : Angle between force vector and displacement

> [!summary] Gravitational Analogy
> - An object a distance $h$ from the ground on Earth has a gravitational potential energy of $mgh$, where:
>
> 	- $m$ : Mass of the object
> 	- $g$ : Gravitational acceleration (constant)
> 	- $mg = W$ : Weight of the object (force)
>
> - This means that the object has a potiental of $mgh$ Joules of energy ($U$) that can be converted into kinetic energy ($K$)
> 	- $E_\text{sys} = U + K$
> 
> - Similarly, a charge a distance $s$ from a "ground position" in a constant electric field has an *electric* potential energy
> $$U = qEs$$
> - where:
> 	- $q$ : Charge of point
> 	- $E$ : Electric field strength
> 	- $qE = F$ : Electric force on the object by an electric field
> 
> - Electric systems have electric potential energy (instead of gravitational) that can be converted to kinetic energy!
> 	- $E_\text{sys} = U_\text{elec} + K$

- Electric energy also follows the law of energy conservation.
