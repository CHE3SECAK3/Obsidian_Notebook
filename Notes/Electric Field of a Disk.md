# Electric Field of a Disk
> [!note] Electric Field Equation
> $$\vec{E}_{\text{disk}} = \frac{\eta}{{2\epsilon_{0}}}\left[1-\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^{2}+R^{2}}}\right]$$ where:
> - $\eta$ : Surface charge density
> - $Q$ : Total charge of ring
> - $z$ : Distance from center of ring to point of interest
> - $R$ : Radius of ring
