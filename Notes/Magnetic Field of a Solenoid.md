# Magnetic Field of a Solenoid
- *Uniform magnetic field*

> [!note] Magnetic Field Equation
> $$\vec{B}_\text{solenoid} = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{L}$$ where:
> - $\mu_{0}$ : Permeability of free space
> - $I$ : Current through solenoid
> - $N$ : Number of turns or loops in solenoid
> - $L$ : Length of solenoid


- A *solenoid* is many loops of wire that form a cylinder. Each loop has the same amount of current through it.

- The magnetic field at any point inside the solenoid is $\vec{B} = \sum\limits_{n} \vec{B}_n$, or the sum of the fields from each loop.
