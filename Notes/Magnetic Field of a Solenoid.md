# Magnetic Field of a Solenoid
- *Uniform magnetic field*

> [!note] Magnetic Field Equation
> $$\vec{B}_\text{solenoid} = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{L}$$ where:
> - $\mu_{0}$ : Permeability of free space
> - $I$ : Current through solenoid
> - $N$ : Number of turns or loops in solenoid
> - $L$ : Length of solenoid

- A *solenoid* is many loops of wire that form a cylinder. Each loop has the same amount of current through it.

- The magnetic field at any point inside the solenoid is $\vec{B} = \sum\limits_{n} \vec{B}_n$ or the sum of the fields from each loop.

> [!note] Ideal Solenoids
> - *Ideal* solenoids have a uniform magnetic field inside and no magnetic field outside
>
> 	- The solenoid would have to be infinitely long and wound as tight as possible
> - Realistically, there is a very small field outside the solenoid, and the field becomes less uniform at the ends of a solenoid

> > [!note] Solenoids and Parallel-Plate Capacitors
> > - Solenoids are analogous to parallel-plate capacitors and their manipulation of the *electric field*
