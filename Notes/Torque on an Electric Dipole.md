# Torque on an Electric Dipole
- In a constant [[electric field]], $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = 0$ on an [[electric dipole]]

	- This is becase the poles (2 point charges) have an equal and opposite force acting on them

- However, a dipole may have a rotational force (or torque) acting on it

$$\vec{\tau} = \vec{p} \times \vec{E}$$
$$\vec{\tau} = p E\sin{\theta}$$

- where:
	
	- $\vec{\tau}$ : Torque
	- $\vec{p}$ : Dipole moment

- $\vec{\tau}_{\text{max}}$ is when the dipole moment is perpendicular to the electric field
	- when $\sin{\theta}$ is max ($\sin 90 = 1$)
- $\vec{\tau} = 0$ when the dipole moment is parallel to the electric field
	- Stable equilibrium when $\theta = 0^\circ$
	- Unstable equilibrium when $\theta = 180^\circ$
