# Electric Field of Multiple Point Charges
- What if there are *multiple* source charges each with their own electric field? How will it influence a point in space?

	- $\vec{E}_{NET} = \vec{E}_{q_1} + \vec{E}_{q_2} + ... + \vec{E}_{q_i} = \sum\limits_i \vec{E}_{q_i}$

> [!summary] Net Electric Field
> The net electric field is the sum of all electric fields due to each source charge
