# Motion of a Charged Particle

> [!summary] Force Equations
> - $\vec{F}_{\text{on q}} = q\vec{E}$

- If the electric field is constant (in a capacitor for example), then the acceleration is constant.

- This means that charged particles behave very similar to large-scale objects affected by an external force.

> [!warning] Charge vs Mass
> - Point charges can be positive *or* negative
>  
> - This means that positive point charges move in the direction of the electric field while negative charges move in the opposite direction
>  
> - This is different than objects affected by gravity, since mass can only be positive and gravity is an attractive force
