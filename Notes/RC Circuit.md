# RC Circuit
- *Circuits with resistors and capacitors*

- Unlike resistor-only or capactior-only circuits, RC circuits are *time-dependent*

- Ohm's Law and capacitance equations are still still applicable but values change based on time
  
	- Solving RC circuits require setting up a *differential equation*

> - Time $t = 0$ is defined when the switch is closed
> - Before $t = 0$, capactior $C$ has an initial charge $Q_{0}= C{\Delta V}_{0}$
