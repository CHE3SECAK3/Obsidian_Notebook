# Coulomb's Law
- *The forces between 2 point charges*

> [!info] Coulomb's Law Formula
> Given 2 point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$, and a distance $r$ between them:
> $$
> \vec{F}_{1,2} = \left[ K \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2} \right] \hat {r}_{1,2}
> $$
> - i.e. The force exerted by $q_1$ onto $q_2$ is equal the unit vector of the distance from $q_1$ to $q_2$ ($\hat {r}$) scaled by the product of the charges and Coulomb's constant ($K$), over the distance squared.
> 
> - $K = \large \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$, where:
> 	- $K = 9 * 10^9 \quad N m^2 C^{-2}$
> 	- $\large \epsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space
> 
> - If the two charges are opposite signs, then $\vec{F}$ would be in the opposite direction of $\hat r$ (indicating attraction).
> - If the two charges are the same sign, then $\vec{F}$ would be in the same direction as $\hat r$ (indicating repulsion).


> [!note] Gravitational Force
> Note the similarities between Coulomb's Law and the Gravitational Force Formula:
> $$K\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \quad\approx\quad G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$
