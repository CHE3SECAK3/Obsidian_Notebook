# Electric Dipole
- *Two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance*

|                | Permanent Dipole                                                  | Induced Dipole                                                   |

| **Definition** | Charges are separated regardless of external fields               | Charge separation is influenced by external fields               |
| **Example**    | Electrons in water molecules spend more time near the oxygen atom | Charging objects by induction creates temporary shifts in charge |

## Electric Dipole Moment
- A vector that describes the direction and the electric field strength of a dipole

- $\vec{p} = qs$ where:
	- $\vec{p}$ : Dipole moment in the direction of $-q$ to $+q$
	- $q$ : magnitude of charge
	- $s$ : distance of separation

## Electric Field at Axis of Symmetry and Bisecting Plane
![[Electric Field of a Dipole]]

> [!note] Electric FIeld Equations
> $$\vec{E}_{AoS} \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{2\vec{p}}{r^{3}}$$
> - This is on the axis of the dipole (y-axis on diagram)
> $$\vec{E}_{BP} \approx -\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{\vec{p}}{r^{3}}$$
> - This is on the bisecting plane (x-axis and z-axis on the diagram)
> > [!note] $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{E}$
> > - $\vec{p}$ is in the direction of $\vec{E}$ on the axis of symmetry
> > - $\vec{p}$ is in the *opposite direction* of $\vec{E}$ on the bisecting axis
