# Dipole
- *Two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance*

|                | Permanent Dipole                                                  | Induced Dipole                                                   |
|:-------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Charges are separated regardless of external fields               | Charge separation is influenced by external fields               |
| **Example**    | Electrons in water molecules spend more time near the oxygen atom | Charging objects by induction creates temporary shifts in charge |
