> [!success] Magnetic Field Equation Proof
> ![[Magnetic Field of a Loop Proof|1000]]

- The points and outside of the loop and its central axis also have magnetic fields

![[Magnetic Field Lines Through a Loop|1000]]

- The magnetic lines look very similar to a bar magnet, which emphasizes that a loop of current-carrying wire is an *electromagnet* with an induced north and south pole indicated by $\vec{\mu}$
