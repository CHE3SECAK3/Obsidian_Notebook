# Electric Field of Ring
> [!note] Electric Field Equation
> $$\vec{E}_{\text{ring}} = \frac{1}{{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}} \frac{{Qz}}{\left({z^{2} + R^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$ where:
> - $Q$ : Total charge of ring
> - $z$ : Distance from center of ring to point of interest
> 	- On the axis of symmetry
> - $R$ : Radius of ring
> - $\epsilon_{0}$ : Permittivity of free space

> [!done] Equation Proof
