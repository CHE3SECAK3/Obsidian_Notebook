# Elementary Row Operations
- Matrices can represent a linear system of equations
- $\therefore$ matrices can be manipulated just like a system of equations

> [!example]- Example
> $$
> \begin{bmatrix}-2 & 0 & 5 & -1 \\ 4 & -1 & 2 & 2 \\ -7 & -6 & 0 & 4\end{bmatrix} \bar{x} = \begin{bmatrix}6 \\ -2 \\ -8\end{bmatrix}$$
>
> - where:
> 	- $\bar{x}$ : $\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c \\ d\end{bmatrix}$ is a column matrix of constants
> 
> - This matrix multiplication can be rewritten as a linear system of equations:
> 
> $$\begin{cases}
-2a & &+ 5c &- d &= 6 \\
4a &- b &+ 2c &+ 2d &= -2 \\
-7a &- 6b & &+ 4d &= -8
\end{cases}$$
> 
> > [!note] Linear Combination
> > - Note how this system (and therefore the matrix  multiplication) can be written as a *linear combination*
