# Passive Sign Convention
![[Sketches/Passive Sign Convention]]

## Electron Flow
- A voltage source (like a battery) creates *electric pressure* that pushes electrons from the negative side of the battery to the attractive positive side through a wire path

- This means that:
	- Electrons flow from a negative to a positive voltage
		- $- \rightarrow_{-i} +$
	- Current ($\frac{C}{s}$) is negative since an electron has $-1.6 \times 10^{19}C$

## Passive Sign Convention
- However, circuit analysis adopted a universal convention to treat current as *positive*

- This means that:

	- Positive current flows through a drop in voltage (positive to negative)
		- $+ \rightarrow_{i} -$

> [!question] Why?
> - Early circuit analysts assumed that current flowed from the positive to the negative terminal (without the knowledge of the electron)
> 
> - The convention is kept since the mathematics behind circuit analysis (Ohm's Law) is consistent regardless of what is considered "positive" and "negative"
