# Inverse Matrix
- *The commutative matrix*
- Given an $n \times n$ matrix $A$:

	- $AA^{-1} = I_{n}$ where:

		- $A^{-1}$ : Inverse matrix of $A$
		- $I_{n}$ : $n \times n$ Identity matrix

- A matrix and its inverse are *commutative*:

	- $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I_{n}$

> [!warning] Commutative Property
> - Recall that in matrix multiplication, $AB$ isn't always equal to $BA$
