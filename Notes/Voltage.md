# Voltage
- *Electric pressure*

- Units: *Volt* -> $V$

- $\large V = \frac{dW}{dQ}$, where:
	- $V$ = voltage ($V$)
	- $W$ = work or $\Delta PE$ ($J$)
	- $Q$ = charge ($C$)

- Also known as the change in electric potential

> [!note] Electromotive Force
> - Before knowing that voltage is an electric potential, circuit analysts believed it was an "electromotive force" or *emf*
>
> - Due to that convention, voltage sources are sometimes labeled as $\epsilon$, which stands for emf
