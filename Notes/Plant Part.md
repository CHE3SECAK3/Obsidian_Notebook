## Cell Wall
- Made of *cellulose*
	- Most abundant polymer on Earth
- Function: Structure and protection
- All plant cells have a thin, flexible *primary* cell wall
- Some cells have additional thick, rigid *secondary* cell wall
- Cellulose structure: 100 - 1000s of $\beta$ linked 
- Cellulose microfibrosis

## Plasma Membrane
- Permeable barrier that regulates momevement of substances in and out of the cell

### Plasmodesmata
- Small channels that connect neighboring cells together fofr the exchange of chemical signals that extend from the cell membrane

## Nucleus
- Control center
- Stores DNA - genetic material
- Instructions for making enzymes and proteins
- Bound by a double membrane (nuclear membrane)

## Chloroplast
- Specialized organelle where photosynthesis occurs
$$\text{sunlight} + \text{water} + \text{carbon dioxide} = \text{sugar / energy}$$
- Contains chlorophyll - green pigment
- Variegated plants: some cells acquire mutations that prevent the production of chlorophyll
