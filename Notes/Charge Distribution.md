# Charge Distribution
- *What is the total charge $Q$ of an object?*

## Definite Rod
- A rod of charge can be thought of as a row of point charges

- Thus, the total charge can be calculated by adding up all the point charges that compose a rod of length $L$ (*Think integral!*)

$$Q = \int\limits_{0}^{L} dQ$$

- But integrating charge with bounds of length makes no sense
- How is $Q$ related to $L$ ?
	- Linear Charge Density 

	- $Q = \lambda L$ where:
		- $\lambda$ : Linear charge density ($\frac{C}{m}$)
		- $Q$ : Total charge ($C$)
		- $L$ : Total length of rod ($m$)

$$ Q = \int\limits_{0}^{L} \lambda dL $$
