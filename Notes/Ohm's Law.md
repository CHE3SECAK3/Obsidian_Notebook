# Ohm's Law
- $V = IR$, where:

	- $V$ : Voltage
	- $I$ : Current
	- $R$ : Resistance

> [!question] Proof?
> For now, take Ohm's Law to be the Circuit BibleÂ®.

> [!note] Ohmic Materials
> - Ohm's Law is only true in materials where the resistance is (very nearly) constant
>
> - Metals and most conductors are ohmic
> - Semiconductors are *not*, and therefore Ohm's Law cannot be applied
