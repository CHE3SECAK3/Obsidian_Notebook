- Inertial Frame: A frame of reference moving at a constant velocity

1. Physical behaviors are the same in all inertial frames
	- No one would know they were in a moving frame relative to another frame
2. Light moves at the same speed relative to all intertial reference frames, proven by the Michelson-Morley experiment
	- Scientists used to believe light propogated through an *ether*, which was considered to be the true resting substance.
	- If ether existed, light would only travel at speed $c$ in a frame relatively stationary to ether, but the experiment concluded that light travels with speed $c$ in all directions regardless of frame

- Event: Anything with a location in space and time
