# Kirchoff's Laws

## Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)
- *The amount of current entering a given node must equal the amount leaving it*
$$\sum i_{\text{in}} = \sum i_\text{out}$$
 
## Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
- *The sum of the voltages around a loop is 0$V$*

$$\sum\limits_{n}v_{n}= 0$$ 
where: 
- $n$ : Number of elements in a loop

> [!important] Solving a Circuit
> - **KCL**, **KVL**, and **Ohm's Law** are essential in solving circuits
