# Kirchoff's Laws

## Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)
- *The amount of [[current]] entering a given [[node]] must equal the amount leaving it*

> [!note] Kirchoff's Current Law
> $$\sum i_{\text{in}} = \sum i_\text{out}$$
 
## Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
- *The sum of the [[Voltage|voltages]] around a loop is 0$V$*

> [!note] Kirchoff's Voltage Law
> $$\sum\limits_{n}v_{n}= 0$$ where: 
> - $n$ : Number of elements in a loop

> [!important] Solving a Circuit
> - **KCL**, **KVL**, and **[[Ohm's Law]]** are essential in solving circuits
