# Electron Current
- *Number of electrons that pass through a section of wire per unit time*

- Symbol : $i_{e}$

> [!note] Electron Current Equation
> $$\begin{align*}
i_{e} &= \frac{N_{e}}{\Delta t}\\ \\
N_{e} &= n_{e} \cdot V = n_{e} \cdot A \Delta x\\ \\
\Delta x &= v_{d} \cdot \Delta t \\\\
i_{e} &= n_{e} \cdot A  \cdot v_{d}\Delta t
\end{align*}$$

> where:
> - $i_{e}$ : Electron current
>
> - $N_{e}$ : Number of electrons that pass through a section of wire
> - $n_{e}$ : Electron density (property of wire material)
> - $V$ : Volume of the section of wire
> - $A$ : Cross-sectional area of wire
> - $\Delta x$ : Distance of wire section
> - $v_{d}$ : Drift velocity -> The speed of a moving electron in a wire

> [!note] Drift Velocity
> - Drift velocity is very slow (~ $10^{-4} \frac{m}{s}$) 
>
> 	- *So how do circuit components get charge fast enough to work?*
>
> - Because electrons travel in large quantities, its slow speed is offset by the total amount of charge a sea of electrons carry

> [!warning] Current vs Electron Current
> - Current ($I$) and electron current ($i_e$) are different but related
>
> - $i_{e} = \large \frac{N_{e}}{s}$, or the number of electrons per second
> - $I = \large \frac{C}{s}$, or the amount of *positive* charge per second
> 
> - Since an electron has a fundamental charge of $-e$, $I = \large{\frac{N_{e} e}{s}} = ei_{e}$
