# Charge
- *A property of protons and electrons*

- Unit: Coulomb ($C$)

### 2 Fundamental Charges
|                                  | **Proton**     | **Electron**    |
|:-------------------------------- |:-------------- |:--------------- |
| **Fundamental Unit of Charge**   | $+e$           | $-e$            |
| **Electric Charge** (*Coulombs*) | $1.6*10^{-19}$ | $-1.6*10^{-19}$ |

- Charge of an object $q = (N_p - N_e)e$
	- $N_p$ = number of protons
	- $N_e$ = number of electrons.

- An object is:

| Charge   |             |
|:-------- |:----------- |
| Positive | $N_p > N_e$ |
| Negative | $N_p < N_e$ |
| Neutral  | $N_p = N_e$ |

- Charge is **quantized**, meaning that an object can only have discrete, integer values of charge.

- The "positivity" or "negativity" of a charge is entirely arbitrary. What matters is that protons have an opposite, attractive charge from electrons, and that 2 of the *same* charges repel each other.
