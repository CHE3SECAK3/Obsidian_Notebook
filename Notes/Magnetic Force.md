# Magnetic Force
- A moving charge creates a magnetic field, but does not interact with its own field (just like how it cannot interact with its own *electric* field)

- A moving charge however is infleunced by *external* magnetic fields

> [!note] Magnetic Force Equation
> $$\vec{F}_{\text{on q}} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}_\text{ext}$$
> - where:
> 	- $\vec{F}_{\text{on q}}$ : Force exerted on moving charge
>
> 	- $q$ : Charge of the particle (positive or negative changes direction of $F$)
> 	- $\vec{B}_\text{ext}$ : An external magnetic field caused by some source

> [!example] Cyclotron Motion
> ![[Cyclotron Motion]]
> - With a uniform magnetic field completely perpendicular to velocity, a charge travels in circular motion
> $$\begin{align*}
F &= qv \times B = qvB\sin(90) = qvB\\\\
F_\text{radial} &= \frac{mv^{2}}{R}
\end{align*}$$
