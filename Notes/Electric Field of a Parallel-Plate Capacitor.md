# Electric Field of a Parallel-Plate Capacitor
- Parallel-Plate Capacitor: Two electrodes a distance apart with equal and opposite charge

- An electrode is a charged surface approximated by an infinite plane

> [!note] Electric Field Equation
> $$\vec{E}_{C}= \begin{cases}\frac{\eta}{\epsilon_{0}}, &\text{inside} \\ 0, &\text{outside}\end{cases}$$ where:
> - $\eta$ : Surface charge density
> - $\epsilon_{0}$ : Permittivity of free space

> [!success] Electric Field Proof
> ![[Parallel-Plate Capacitor]]
> - Points to remember:
> 	- Positive plates have a repulsive field
> 	 
> 	- Negative plates have an attractive field
> 	- Electric field is constant any distance away from a plate
> 		- $\vec{E}_\text{net}$ is either doubled or neutralized depending on where the point of interest is
