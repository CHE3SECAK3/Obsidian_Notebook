# Electric Field of a Parallel-Plate Capacitor
- *Two electrodes a distance apart with equal and opposite charge*

- An electrode is a charged surface approximated by an infinite plane

$$\vec{E}_{C}= \begin{cases}\frac{\eta}{\epsilon_{0}}, &\text{inside} \\ 0, &\text{outside}\end{cases}$$

> - Points to remember:
> 	- Positive plates have a repulsive field
> 	 
> 	- Negative plates have an attractive field
> 	- Electric field is constant any distance away from a plate
> 		- $\vec{E}_\text{net}$ is either doubled or neutralized depending on where the point of interest is
