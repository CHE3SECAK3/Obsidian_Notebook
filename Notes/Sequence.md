# Sequence

This sequence seems intuitive but isn't rigorous. What does "$...$" mean? $5$? $\pi$?

Therefore, *formulas* are used to be more explicit.

> The Fibonacci Sequence would've been hard to represent as a loose list, so a *recursive* formula was used. Recurisve formulas use previous terms to describe future terms.
