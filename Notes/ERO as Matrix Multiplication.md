# Elementary Row Operations as Matrix Multiplication

- How can an ERO be represented as a matrix?

 > [!example] Permutation
> Example Matrix:
> $$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 & 5 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 6 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$
> If the desired ERO is swapping row 2 and 3,
> Swapping row 2 and 3 would result in:
> $$\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 & 5\\ 0 & 6 & 1\\ 3 & 1 & 2\end{bmatrix}$$
