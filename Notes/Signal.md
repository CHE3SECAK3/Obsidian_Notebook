# Periodic Signals
- $x(t)$ is periodic with a period  $T_{0}$  if  $x(t) = x(t + T_{0})$  for all  $t$
- The smallest $T_0$ is called the *fundamental period*
- Given two periodic signals with periods $T_1$ and $T_2$, the sum of of those signals is periodic $\iff$ $\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}} \in Q$ 
- $$

- To find the even and odd part of a signal, 
- $x_{e}(t) = \frac{x(t) + x(-t)}{2}$
- $x_{o}(t) = \frac{x(t) - x(-t)}{2}$
