# Predicate
- *A statement whose truth value is dependent on one or more variables*

- Predicates turn into [[Proposition|propositions]] if the variables are given values, since a truth value can then be evaluated

- Variables have a domain, which is a set of all possible inputs. Unless implied, the domain needs to be defined

>[!example] Predicate Example
> - $P(x) : x + 1 = 5$
>
> - $Q(x, y) : x^{2}+ y^{2}= 1$
> 
> - The store has no milk
> 	- Domain: All grocery stores in the Pacific Northwest
> 
> - If all variables in a predicate are assigned a value 
>   ($x = 3, y = 4, \text{store } = \text{ Safeway}$), then the predicate becomes a proposition

> 	  - However, the statement remains a predicate until a value is assigned to $x$
