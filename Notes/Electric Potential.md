# Electric Potential

- *The electric energy infleunce of a charge*

- Electric potential can be modeled by: $$U_\text{elec} = qV \quad \text{where:}$$
	- $U$ : Electric potential energy
	- $q$ : Point charge of interest
	- $V$ : Electric potential of a *source charge*

- The difference in electric potential between 2 points ($\Delta V$) is known as *voltage*

> [!seealso] Electric Potential and Electric Field
> - $\vec{E}$ determines $F_\text{elec}$ on any charge in the vector field
>
> - $V$ determines $U_\text{elec}$ on any charge in the *scalar* field
> 
> - Both are determined using a *source charge* that affects the space around it

> [!seealso] $V$, $U$, and $\vec{E}$
> - If a positive charge $\downarrow U$ along $\vec{E}$ :
> 
> 	- $\downarrow U = q (\downarrow V) \quad\therefore \quad \uparrow K \quad\therefore\quad \frac{1}{2} m (\uparrow v)^2$
>
> 	- Positive charges speed up through a *drop* in potential ($-\Delta V$)
>
> - If a positive charge $\uparrow U$ in the opposite direction of $\vec{E}$ :
> 	- Positive charges slow down through a *rise* in potential ($\Delta V$)
>
> - Negative charges have the opposite effect
