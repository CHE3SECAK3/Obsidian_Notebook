# Electric Potential

- *The electric energy infleunce of a charge*

- Symbol : $V$

- Units : $V$ (Volts)

> [!note] Electric Potential Equation
> - Electric potential energy can be modeled by: $$U = qV$$ where
> 	- $U$ : Electric potential energy
> 	- $q$ : Point charge of interest
> 	- $V$ : Electric potential of a *source charge*

- The difference in electric potential between 2 points ($\Delta V$) is known as *voltage*

> [!seealso] Electric Potential and Electric Field
> - $\vec{E}$ determines $F_\text{elec}$ on any charge in the vector field
> 	- $F = q\vec{E}$
>
> - $V$ determines $U_\text{elec}$ on any charge in the *scalar* field
> 	- $U = qV$
> 
> - Both are determined using a *source charge* that affects the space around it

> [!seealso] $V$, $U$, $F$ and $E$
> - If a positive charge $\downarrow U$ along $\vec{E}$ :
> 
> 	- $\downarrow U = q (\downarrow V) \quad\therefore \quad \uparrow KE \quad\therefore\quad \frac{1}{2} m (\uparrow v)^2$
>
> 	- Positive charges speed up through a *drop* in potential ($-\Delta V$)
>
> - If a positive charge $\uparrow U$ in the opposite direction of $\vec{E}$ :
> 	- Positive charges slow down through a *rise* in potential ($\Delta V$)
>
> - Negative charges have the opposite effect

\Delta U &= -W \\ \\
-W &= -\int\limits_{i}^{f} F \cdot dx \\\\
F &= qE \\\\
-W &= -\int\limits_{i}^{f} qE \cdot dx \\\\
\Delta V &= \frac{\Delta U}{q} \\\\
\Delta V &= -\int\limits_{i}^{f} E \cdot dx
\end{align*}$$

> [!warning] Electric Potential Energy vs Electric Potential
> - Electric potential energy is *not the same* as electric potential (even though they sound similar)
>
> - They are related by $U = qV$
