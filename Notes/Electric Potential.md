# Electric Potential

- *The electric energy infleunce of a charge*

- Electric potential can be modeled by: $$U_\text{elec} = qV \quad \text{where:}$$
	- $U$ : Electric potential energy
	- $q$ : Point charge of interest
	- $V$ : Electric potential of a *source charge*

> [!seealso] Electric Field vs Electric Potential
> - $\vec{E}$ determines $F_\text{elec}$ on any charge in the vector field
>
> - $V$ determines $U_\text{elec}$ on any charge in the *scalar* field
> 
> - Both are determined using a *source charge* that affects the space around it

## Formula
- $V = K \large\frac{q}{r}\quad$ where:

	- $V$ : Electric potential
	- $K$ : Coulomb's constant
	- $q$ : Source charge
	- $r$ : An arbitrary distance from $q$
