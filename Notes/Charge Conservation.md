# Law of Conservation of Charge
- *Charges cannot be created or destroyed*
	- In an electrically isolated system:
		- Number of protons and electrons cannot change 
		$\therefore$ Net charge stays constant -> $\sum\text{Q}_{SYS} = 0$

- Electrons can be moved within materials and between objects as long as the net charge is conserved

> [!note] Conservation and Current
> - The only way to decrease the current through a wire is to decrease the charge of the electrons or the drift speed of the electrons
> 	- Electrons have a fundamental charge $e$ that can't be changed
