# Law of Conservation of Charge
- *[[Charge|Charges]] cannot be created or destroyed*
	- In an electrically isolated system:
		- Number of protons and electrons cannot change 
		$\therefore$ Net charge stays constant -> $\sum\text{Q}_{SYS} = 0$

- Electrons can be moved within materials and between objects as long as the net charge in the system is conserved
