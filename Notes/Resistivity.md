# Resistivity
- *The measure of a material's ability to resist current*

- Symbol: $\rho$

- Units: $\ohm \cdot m$

- $\rho \propto \large \frac{1}{\sigma}$
	- Resisitivity is inversely proportional to conductivity

- Typical metals used for wires:
	- $\text{Al}$ (Aluminium) -> Highest $\rho$ $\therefore$ Lowest $\sigma$
	- $\text{Cu}$ (Copper)
	- $\text{Ag}$ (Silver) -> Lowest $\rho$ $\therefore$ Highest $\sigma$
	- $\text{Au}$ (Gold)

> [!question] Why Not Use Silver Everywhere?
> - Although $\text{Ag}$ has high conductance, it tarnishes easily

> [!note] Resistivity vs Resistance
> - Materials have an inherent resistivity, but a specific wire's *resistance* is also dependent on:
>
> 	- $\ell$ : Length of wire
> 	- $A$ : Minimim cross-sectional area of wire
>
> - $R = \rho \large \frac{\ell}{A}$
>
> 	- The longer the wire, the more distance electrons have to travel, which increases resistance ($R \propto \ell$)
>
> 	- A larger area of wire allows electrons to pass more easily, which decreases resistance ($R \propto \frac{1}{A}$)
