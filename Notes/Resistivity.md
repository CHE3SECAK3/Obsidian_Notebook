# Resistivity
- *A property of a material*

- Symbol: $\rho$

- Units: $\ohm \cdot m$

- $R = \rho \large \frac{\ell}{A}$ where:
	- $R$ : Resistance ($\ohm$)
	- $\rho$ : Resistivity
	- $\ell$ : Length of wire
	- $A$ : Minimim cross-sectional area of wire

- $\rho \propto \large \frac{1}{\text{conductivity}}$
	- Resisitivity is inversely proportional to conductivity

- Typical metals used for wires
	- $\text{Al}$ (Aluminium)
	- $\text{Cu}$ (Copper)
	- $\text{Ag}$ (Silver)
	- $\text{Au}$ (Gold)
	- Aluminium has highest resistivity
	- Silver has lowest resistivity
		- However Gold is tend to be used more because it doesn't oxidize / tarnish unlike silver (with sulfur)
