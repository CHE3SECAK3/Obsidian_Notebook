- A sequence of precise instructions to solve a problem

- Algorithms should:
	- Take inputs (problems) and produce outputs (solutions)
	- Be definite and precise as possible to avoid ambiguity
	- Be correct and consistent
	- Be finite and general (it should be able to take any valid input)

>[!example] $\text{BINARY SEARCH}(x, A=(a_{0,}a_1,...,a_n))$
>$$\begin{align}
>\
>&\text{Input: An int } x \text{ and a finite, non-empty sequence } A \text{ of n ints}
>\\&\text{Output: Whether or not } x \text{ is in sequence } A
