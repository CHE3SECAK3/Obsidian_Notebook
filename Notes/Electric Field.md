# Electric Field

- The force on an object is dependent on:

	- The property of the object
	- A property of the location

> [!example]- Gravity
> $$
> \vec{F}_g = m \vec{g}
> $$

- An *electric* force can be modeled by:

$$\vec{F}_{\textit{on q}} = q \vec{E}\quad \text{where:}$$
- q: Point charge -> Property of the object
- $\vec{E}$: Electric Field of a *source charge* -> Property of the location
---
- A *source charge* creates an electric field in the space around it, which can apply a force on point charges ( $q$ ) in the electric field.

- The force on a positive charge is *in the direction* of $\vec{E}$
- The force on a negative charge is *in the opposite direction* of $\vec{E}$

## Formula
- $\vec{E} = K \large{\frac{q}{r^2}} \hat r \left[\frac{N}{C}\right]$, where:
	- $K$ : Coulomb's Constant

	- $q$ : Source charge
		- The sign of the charge matters!

			- $+q$ : The field points away from source charge
			(in the direction of $\hat r$)

			- $-q$ : The field points towards the source charge
			(opposite direction of $\hat r$)
	- $r$ : An arbitrary distance from the source charge
	- $\hat r$ : Unit vector of the distance between the source chage and any arbitrary point

> [!note] Coulomb's Law
> - Notice the similarities between Coulomb's Law and the Electric Field equation.
>   
> 	- $\vec{E}$ only needs one *source charge*
> 	- Coulomb's Law uses a pair of charges

## $\vec{E}$ of Multiple Point Charges
- What if there are *multiple* source charges each with their own electric field? How will it influence a point in space?

	- $\vec{E}_{NET} = \vec{E}_{q_1} + \vec{E}_{q_2} + ... + \vec{E}_{q_i} = \displaystyle \sum_i \vec{E}_{q_i}$

> [!summary] Net Electric Field
> The net electric field is the sum of all electric fields due to each source charge
