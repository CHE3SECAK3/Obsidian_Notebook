# Electric Field
- *The electric force influence of a charge*

- An electric force can be modeled by:

$$\vec{F}_{\textit{on q}} = q \vec{E}\quad \text{where:}$$
- q: Point charge -> Property of the object

- $\vec{E}$: Electric Field of a *source charge* -> Property of the location
	- Units: $\frac{N}{C}$ or $\frac{V}{m}$, where $V= \frac{J}{C}$

- A *source charge* creates an electric field in the space around it, which can apply a force on point charges ( $q$ ) in the electric field.

- The force on a positive charge is *in the direction* of $\vec{E}$
- The force on a negative charge is *in the opposite direction* of $\vec{E}$
