# Electric Field
- *The electric force influence of a [[charge]]*

- Symbol : $\vec{E}$

- Units : $\frac{N}{C}$

> [!note] Electric Field Equation
> - An electric force can be modeled by: $$\vec{F}_{\textit{on q}} = q \vec{E}$$ where:
> 	- $q$ : Point charge -> Property of the object
>
> 	- $\vec{E}$ : Electric Field of a *source charge* -> Property of the location

- A *source charge* creates an electric field in the space around it, which can apply a force on point charges ( $q$ ) in the electric field.

- The force on a positive charge is *in the direction* of $\vec{E}$
- The force on a negative charge is *in the opposite direction* of $\vec{E}$
