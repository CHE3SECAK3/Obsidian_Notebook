# Electric Field
- *The electric vector influencer*

- An electric force can be modeled by:

$$\vec{F}_{\textit{on q}} = q \vec{E}\quad \text{where:}$$
- q: Point charge -> Property of the object
- $\vec{E}$: Electric Field of a *source charge* -> Property of the location

- A *source charge* creates an electric field in the space around it, which can apply a force on point charges ( $q$ ) in the electric field.

- The force on a positive charge is *in the direction* of $\vec{E}$
- The force on a negative charge is *in the opposite direction* of $\vec{E}$

## Formula
- $\vec{E} = K \large{\frac{q}{r^2}} \hat r \left[\frac{N}{C}\right]$, where:
	- $K$ : Coulomb's Constant

	- $q$ : Source charge
		- The sign of the charge matters!

			- $+q$ : The field points away from source charge
			(in the direction of $\hat r$)

			- $-q$ : The field points towards the source charge
			(opposite direction of $\hat r$)
	- $r$ : An arbitrary distance from the source charge
	- $\hat r$ : Unit vector of the distance between the source charge and any arbitrary point

> [!note] Coulomb's Law
> - Notice the similarities between Coulomb's Law and the Electric Field equation.
>   
> 	- $\vec{E}$ only needs one *source charge*
> 	- Coulomb's Law uses a pair of charges
