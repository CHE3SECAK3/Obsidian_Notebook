# Magnetic Field of A Wire 

> [!note] Magentic Field Equation
> $$\begin{align*}
\vec{B}_\text{segment} &= \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi} \frac{I\Delta \vec{s} \times \hat{r}}{r^{2}}\\\\
\left|\vec{B}_\text{wire}\right| &= \frac{\mu_{0}}{2\pi} \frac{I}{r}
\end{align*}$$
> - For an infinite wire, $r$ is just the height of the point of interest from the wire (which is noted as $y$ in the proof)
