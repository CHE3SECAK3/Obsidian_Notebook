# Stem Growth
- Primary growth takes place in:
	- At the apical meristem
	- At the axillary buds
	- In the root system
- Growth order usually goes: Stem --> Leaf --> Bud

## Phototropism and Auxin
- When sunlight is overhead, the IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) molecules produced by the meristem spread evenly in the shoot, which makes the plant grow straight
- If the sunlight is at an angle, IAA molecules go to the other side and allows elongation towards the light

## Function of Stem
- Transport of nutrients and water via vascular system
- Support for (photosynthetic) leaves
- Storage of water and energy in the ground tissue

## Internal Stem Structure
- From outer to inner:
	- Epidermal tissue
	- Cortex: Outer ring of ground tissue
	- Vascular tissue
	- Pith: Inner ring of ground tissue
		- For storage and support

## Modified Stem
- Stolon: "Runner" stems --> Strawberry plant
  ![[strawberry_stolon.jpg|300]]
	- Horizontal stem growth above ground
	- Strawberries undergo *asexual propogation* through stolons that grow away from the mother plant and start rooting themselves
- Rhizome: Horizontal stem growth underground --> Ginger
- Succulent stem: Round stems optimized for water storage --> Cacti
- Bulb: Underground storage stem with fleshy leaves for storage --> Onion
- Tuber: Swollen end of underground stem that stores nutrients --> Potato
- Thorn: Sharp, pointed stem for protection --> Rose thorns

# Root Growth
- Taproot: One main root that grows downwards
	- Carrots, radishes, etc
	- Most are eudicots
- Fibrous roots: Many branching roots with no prominent root
	- Wheat, corn, etc
	- Most are monocots
- Roots have:
	- Root cap: Protects the root apical meristem
		- Root apical meristem produces *mucigel*, a lubricant that allows the root to burrow without damage
		- Root cap cells are constantly destroyed and regenerated as root apical meristem grows
	- No node
	- Root hairs for water absorption
- 1937 Root Hair Experiment
	- Rye plant grown in a shoebox sized container of soil for 4 months
	- Functional surface area of the roots are greater by orders of magnitude than the shoot system

- Angiosperm : Flowering plants (90% of plants are angiosperms)
	- Monocots: Lilies, orchids, grass, etc
	- Eudicots: Roses, tomatoes, poppies, avocado, etc

- Endodermis in roots
	- Ring of cells surrounding vascular cylinder
	- Each endodermis cell is surrounded by a *Casparian strip* which has suberin and lignin. The sptrip is waterproof
	- apoplastic movememt of water barred due to strip. without it, the leakage of water between endodermis cells would be bad since groundwater contains unwanted bacterial and fungal nonsense
- Pericycle layer right insisde endodermis layer
	- Layer of meristematic cells where lateral roots develop
	- Later roots emerges from the pericycle from inside the primary root
	- lateral roots maintain connection with the vascular tissue
