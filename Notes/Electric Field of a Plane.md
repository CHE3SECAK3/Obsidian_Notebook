# Electric Field of a Plane
> [!note] Electric Field Equation 
> $$\vec{E}_{\text{plane}} = \frac{\eta}{2\epsilon_{0}}$$ where:
> - $\eta$ : Surface charge density
> - $\epsilon_{0}$ : Permittivity of free space

> [!info] Strength of Electric Field
> - For an infinite plane of charge, the strength of the electric field is *independent* of the distance between the point of interest and the plane.
> 
> - This is because any distance from a plane that is infinitely bigger than said distance is relatively negligible
>   
>   - For a *finite* plane, the infinite plane equation can be used as long as the point of interest is not too close to the edge of the surface
