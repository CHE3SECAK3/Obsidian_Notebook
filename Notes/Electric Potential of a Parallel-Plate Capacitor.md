# Electric Potential of a Parallel-Plate Capacitor

- [[Parallel-Plate Capacitor|Parallel-Plate Capacitors]] have a constant electric field $\vec{E} = \large \frac{\eta}{\epsilon_{0}}$ 

- Charges in a capacitor have a potential energy $U = qEs$ and $U = qV$ so $$V_\text{C} = Es$$ where:
	- $V_\text{C}$ : Voltage at a point in capacitor
	- $E$ : Electric field strength inside capacitor
	- $s$ : Distance from the negative plate

- $\vec{E}$ can be calculated with voltage and distance between the capacitor's electrodes: $\frac{\Delta V_{C}}{d}$, where:
	- $\Delta V_{C}$ : Potential difference between the electrodes of a capacitor
	- $d$ : Distance between electrodes ($s_\text{max}$)
	- Units of electric field: $E = \large{\frac{N}{C}} = \large{\frac{V}{m}}$

- Useful when $V_C$ can be measured but $\eta$ is unknown

- $\vec{E}$ is in the direction (positive to negative plate) of a voltage drop
	- $\Delta V_{C} = V_{f} - V_{i} = qE(s_{0}) - qE(s_{max}) = -qEd$

- Capacitors have equipotential lines parallel to the plates since potential does't change if a charge is to the left or right ($V = qEs$)
