# Magnetic Field of a Point Charge

> [!note] Biot-Savart Law
> $$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec{v} \times \hat{r}}{r^{2}}$$ where:
> - $\mu_{0}$ : Permeability of free space
> 	- Magnetic equivalent to the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_{0}$)
>
> - $q$ : Source point charge
> - $\vec{v}$ : Velocity of point charge
> - $\hat{r}$ : Unit distance vector between source and point of interest
> - $r$ : Distance between source charge and point of interest
