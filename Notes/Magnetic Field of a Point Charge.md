# Magnetic Field of a Point Charge

> [!note] Biot-Savart Law
> $$\begin{align*} \vec{B} &= \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec{v} \times \hat{r}}{r^{2}}\\ \\
\left|\vec{B}\right| &= \frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\frac{|q|v\sin{\theta}}{r^{2}}
\end{align*}$$
> where:
> - $\mu_{0}$ : Permeability of free space -> $10^{-7} \cdot 4\pi$
> 	- Magnetic equivalent to the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_{0}$)
>
> - $q$ : Source point charge
> - $\vec{v}$ : Velocity of point charge -> $v$ : Speed of point charge
> - $\hat{r}$ : Unit distance vector between source and point of interest
> - $r$ : Distance between source charge and point of interest 
> - $\theta$ : Angle between $\vec{v}$ and $\hat{r}$

- The magnetic field vector is proportional to the *cross-product* between a moving charge and the distance from the source to a point of interest

- Like an electric field, every point in space has a magnetic field due to a source charge, but not all are drawn for simplicity

> [!note] $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{v}$
> - Only a *moving* charge has a magnetic field. A stationary field has no magnetic field
> - if $\vec{v} = 0$, then $q\vec{v} \times \hat r = \vec{0} \quad \text{(the zero vector)}$


> [!note] $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{E}$
> - Both the magnetic field and the electric field are proportional to the inverse square of distance
> $$\begin{align*}
\vec{E} \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}} \\
\vec{B} \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}
\end{align*}$$

## Multiple Point Charges
- If there are multiple moving source charges, the magnetic field at a point of interest is the sum of all magnetic fields
$$\vec{B}_\text{net} = \sum\limits_{n} \vec{B}_n$$
