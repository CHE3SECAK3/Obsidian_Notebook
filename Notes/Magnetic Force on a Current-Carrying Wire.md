# Magnetic Force on a Wire

> [!note] Magnetic Force Equation
> $$\vec{F}_\text{wire} = \vec{I\ell} \times \vec{B}$$
> - where:
>
> 	- $I$ : Current throug the wire
>
> 	- $\ell$ : Lenth of wire in the external field
>
> 	- $B$ : External magnetic force

> [!example] Force of 2 Wires
> - Wires with current in the same direction *attract* each other
>
> - Wires with current in the opposite direction *repel* each other

> - Example of opposite currents:
