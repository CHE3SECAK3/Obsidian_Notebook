- "Complex" tissues compared to simple parenchyma, collenchyma, or sclerenchyma

- 3 main tissue systems:
	1. Epidermal Tissue
	2. Ground Tissue
	3. Vascular Tissue

## Epidermal (Surface) Tissue
- Outermost layer of cells (epidermis)
- Stops water from seeping in and out of the cell wall
	- Covered with a waxy *cuticle* layer to prevent water loss
- Cell types:
	- Epidermal cells, root hairs, guard cells, trichomes

### Glandular Trichomes
- *Leaf hairs*
- Attached directly to the surface of the epidermis
- Different function for different plants
	- Capturing insects (e.g. sundew)

	- Decreased air flow to reduce water loss
	- Chemical signal emitters
	- Toxic chemicals (like produced by stinging nettle)

### Stomata
- Pores in leaves and stems where gas exchange occurs and water evaporates
- Surrounded by *guard cells* to open and close the pores
	- $CO_{2}$ enters, $O_{2}$ and water exits

## Ground Tissue
- Between epidermal and vascular tissue as a "filling tissue"
- Made of parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma
- Variety of functions (photosynthesis, storage, support)

## Vascular Tissue
- Specialized tissue for sugar and water transportation
- 2 distinct tissues:
	1. Xylem: Water conducting tissue
	2. Phloem: Sugar conducting tissue

### Xylem
- Transports water and minerals
- Strong structure and held by a lot of *lignin*
- Cell types:
	- Tracheids
		- Tapered at the ends
		- Water passes between different tracheids through thin areas in the cell wall called *pits*
	- Vessel elements
		- Long tubular cells open at both ends
		- Arranged end to end forming vessels that function like water pipes
	- Vessels are more efficient water conductors than tracheids
		- However, tracheids are good at supporting water pressure as it travels up and down the plant
- Composed of fibers and parenchyma cells

### Phloem
- Transports sugars and other substances
- Cell types:
	- Sieve tube members
		- Long tubular cells with sieve plates in the end walls
		- Arranged end to end, alive but lack a nucleus
	- Copmanion cells
		- Help and mediate the transport of sugars in sieve tubes members
		- Contains genetic information and maintains pressure in the tissue
- Also made of some fibers and parenchyma
