- Primary growth takes place in:
	- At the apical meristem
	- At the axillary buds
	- In the root system
- Growth order usually goes: Stem --> Leaf --> Bud

## Phototropism and Auxin
- When sunlight is overhead, the IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) molecules produced by the meristem spread evenly in the shoot, which makes the plant grow straight
- If the sunlight is at an angle, IAA molecules go to the other side and allows elongation towards the light

## Function of Stem
- Transport of nutrients and water via vascular system
- Support for (photosynthetic) leaves
- Storage of water and energy in the ground tissue

## Internal Stem Structure
- From outer to inner:
	- Epidermal tissue
	- Cortex: Outer ring of ground tissue
	- Vascular tissue
	- Pith: Inner ring of ground tissue
		- For storage and support

## Modified Stem
- Stolon: "Runner" stems (e.g. strawberry plant)
  ![[strawberry_stolon.jpg|300]]
	- Horizontal stem growth above ground
	- Strawberries undergo *asexual propogation* through stolons that grow away from the mother plant and start rooting themselves

- Rhizome
	- Horizontal stem growth underground
		- Ginger plant

- Succulent stem
	- Round stems optimized for water storage --> Seen on cacti

- Bulb: underground storage stem with flesky leaves for storage
- tuber: swollen end of underground stem
- thorn: sharp pointer stem for protection

# Root System
- Anchorage
- Absoption
- Conduction
- Storage
- Hormone Production
