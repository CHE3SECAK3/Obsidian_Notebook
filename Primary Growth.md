- Primary growth takes place in:
	- At the apical meristem
	- At the axillary buds
	- In the root system
- Growth order usually goes: Stem --> Leaf --> Bud

## Phototropism and Auxin
- When sunlight is overhead, the IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) molecules produced by the meristem spread evenly in the shoot, which makes the plant grow straight
- If the sunlight is at an angle, IAA molecules go to the other side and allows elongation towards the light

## Function of Stem
- Transport of nutrients and water via vascular system
- Support for (photosynthetic) leaves
- Storage of water and energy in the ground tissue

## Internal Stem Structure
- From outer to inner:
	- Epidermal tissue
	- Cortex: Outer ring of ground tissue
	- Vascular tissue
	- Pith: Inner ring of ground tissue
		- For storage and support

## Modified Stem
- Stolon: "Runner" stems --> Strawberry plant
  ![[strawberry_stolon.jpg|300]]
	- Horizontal stem growth above ground
	- Strawberries undergo *asexual propogation* through stolons that grow away from the mother plant and start rooting themselves
- Rhizome: Horizontal stem growth underground --> Ginger
- Succulent stem: Round stems optimized for water storage --> Cacti
- Bulb: Underground storage stem with fleshy leaves for storage --> Onion
- Tuber: Swollen end of underground stem that stores nutrients --> Potato
- Thorn: Sharp, pointed stem for protection --> Rose thorns
