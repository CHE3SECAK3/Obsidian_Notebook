- At the apical meristem
- At the axillary buds
- In the root system

## Phototropism and Auxin
- When sunlight is overhead, the IAA (Indole-3-acetic acid) molecules produced by the meristem spread evenly in the shoot, which makes the plant grow straight
- If the sunlight is at an angle, IAA molecules go to the other side and allows elongation towards the light

## Function of Stem
- Transport --> vasular tissue to transport water and sugar
- supprt holds leaves for photosynthesis
- storage ground tissue for storage of water adn sugar

## Internal Stem Structure
- Pith: Stem center for storage support
- Cortex
- Epidermis

## Stem Grwoth order
- Stem leaf bud consistent growth

- Stolon: modified stem " RUnner" (strawberry plant)
	- Horizontal stem above ground
	- function: vegetative reprodution

- Rhizome
	- Horizontal underground stem (ginger)

- succulent stems
	- roudn water storing stems

- bulbs: underground storage stem with flesky leaves for storage
- tuber: swollen end of underground stem
- thorn: sharp pointer stem for protection

# Root System
- Anchorage
- Absoption
- Conduction
- Storage
- Hormone Production
