- 3 main tissue types:
	1. Parenchyma
	2. Collenchyma
	3. Sclerenchyma

## Parenchyma Tissue
- Most common tissue

- Parenchyma cells are alive when fully mature
- Have thin primary cell walls and large central vacuoles
- Can have many shapes and perform many functions (photosynthesis, storage / transport of nutrients, etc)
- Storage parenchyma cells contain *amyloplasts* (similar structure to chloroplasts), which store starch molecules for energy

## Collenchyma Tissue
- Cells have elastic cell walls that can thicken and deform

- Present in elongating shoots that require more flexible and long cells
- Present under the epidermal layer as thickened cells for extra protection

## Sclerenchyma Tissue
- Sclerenchyma cells have thick secondary walls that contain *lignin* (a strong chemical binding agent)

- Great for support and protection
- Cells die at maturity
- Two types of sclerenchyma cells:
	1. Fibers
	2. Sclereids

### Fiber
- Elongated, thread-like structure
- Provides rigidity to leaves, stems, roots, etc

#### Types of Consumed Fibers
- Cellulosic: Pulped plant fibers that are synthetically re-extruded
- Natural fiber: Whole, natural fibers
- Spunlaid: Nonwoven fibers like coffee filters

### Sclereids
- "Stone cells"
- Composes hard tissue found on outer layer of nuts, seed coats, etc
- Compact, rigid shape
- Contains a central pit known as *lumen*
