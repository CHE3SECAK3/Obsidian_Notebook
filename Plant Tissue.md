# Tissue Types

- 3 main tissue types:
	1. Parenchyma
	2. Collenchyma
	3. Sclerenchyma

## Parenchyma Tissue
- Most common tissue
- Parenchyma cells are alive when fully mature
- Have thin primary cell walls and large central vacuoles
- Can have many shapes and perform many functions (photosynthesis, storage / transport of nutrients, etc)

- Storage parenchyma cells contain *amyloplasts* (similar structure to chloroplasts), which store starch molecules for energy

## Collenchyma Tissue
- Collenchyma cells contain some thickened primary cell walls (unlike the usual thinness of primary walls)

- 3 main tissue systems:
	1. Epidermal Tissue
	2. Ground Tissue
	3. Vascular Tissue





## Sclerenchyma Tissue
- Dead at maturity
- Thick secondary cell walls reinforced by *lignin*
- Cell type:
	1. Fiber
		- Thread like structure
		- Elongated sclerenchyma cell
		- Provides structure to leaves, stems, roots, etc
		- Abundant in fibers
	2. Sclereids
		- Stone cells
		- Form hard tissue of nuts, seed coats, etc
		- Compact shape
		- Usually with thin-walled parenchyma cells

### Cellulosic vs Natural Fibers
- Cellulosic: Plant fibers processed to a pulp and extruded like sunthetic fiber
- Natural fiber: Whole, natural fibers
- Spunlaid: Nonwowev fibers like coffee filters


# Plant Tissue System
## Epidermal (Surface) Tissue
- Outermost layer of cells (epidermis)
- Stops water from seeping in and out of the cell wall
	- Covered with a waxy cuticle layer to prevent water loss
- Cell types:
	- Epidermal cells, root hairs, guard cells, trichomes

### Glandular Trichomes
- *Leaf hairs*
- Attached directly to the surface of the epidermis
- Different function for different plants
	- Capturing insects
	- Decreased air flow to reduce water loss
	- Chemical signal emitters
	- Pain

### Stomata
- Pores in leaves and stems where gas exchange occurs and water evaporates
- Surrounded by guard cells to open and close the pores
	- $CO_{2}$ enters, $O_{2}$ and water exists

## Ground Tissue
- Between epidermal and vascular tissue as a "filling tissue"
- Made of parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma
- Variety of functions (photosynthesis, storage, support)

## Vascular Tissue
- Specialized tissue for sugar and water transportation
- 2 distinct tissues:
	1. Xylem: Water conducting tissue
	2. Phloem: Sugar conducting tissue

### Xylem
- Transports water and minerals
- Strong structure and held by a lot of lignin
- Composed of different cell types
	- Tracheids: Tapered at the ends, water passes betw tracheids through thin areas in the cell wall called pits
	- Vessel elements: Long tubular cells open at both ends, arranged end to end forming vessels that function like water pipes
	- Vessels are more efficient water conductors than tracheids
		- However, tracheids are good at supporting water pressure as it travels up and down the plant
- Made of fibers and parenchyma as well

### Phloem
- Transports sugats and other substances
- Sieve tube members
	- Long tubular cells with sieve plates in the end walls, arranged end to end, alive but lack a nucleus
- Copmanion cells
	- Help and mediate the transport of sugars in sieve tubes members
	- Contains genetic information and maintains pressure in the tissue
- Also made of some fibers and parenchyma
